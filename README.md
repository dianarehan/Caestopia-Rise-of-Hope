# Caestopia: Rise of Hope

In "Caestopia: Rise of Hope," you hold the future of your kingdom in your hands. Will you lead Caestopia to greatness, or let it fall into darkness? Choose wisely, because the lives of your people depend on it.

This game was made entirely by our team, including the music. We didn't use any pre-made assets or AI-generated content, and we wrote all the code during the jam's time limit.

- The team was responsible for sound and concept design game development, art design, characters, and UI design.
